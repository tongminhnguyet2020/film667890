When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters."

Foster, while investigating the phenomenon, is transported to another realm and comes in contact with a substance called Aether. Upon coming into contact with the substance, it draws Thor from Asgard back to Earth. Thor takes Jane to Asgard to be cured from the Aether. Unfortunately in doing so it draws more than just Jane to that world. Another being called Malekith wants to use the Aether to destroy Asgard. Devising a plan with his brother - the war criminal Loki, Thor heads to \"The Dark World\" to destroy the Aether and save Asgard. But can Loki be trusted?"

On their first night, deep in the forest, they have an unsettling encounter with Brad (Eric Balfour), a strange alpha male with eyes for Jenn who may or may not be following them. Alex's desire to quickly reach Blackfoot Trail only intensifies. They push further and further into the woods, Alex stubbornly insisting that he remembers the way. After three days their path disappears; they are hopelessly lost. Without food or water, they struggle to find their way back, the harsh conditions bringing out the best and worst in them, pushing their already fragile relationship to the breaking point."

When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one there, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of the Black Widow and his new friend, The Falcon. However, the battle will be costly for the Sentinel of Liberty, with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them while learning that the Winter Soldier looks disturbingly familiar."

    "storyline": "In Liberty City, Miami, Cuban drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali) finds Chiron (Alex Hibbert), a withdrawn child who goes by the nickname \"Little,\" hiding from a pack of bullies in a crackhouse. Juan allows Chiron to spend the night with him and his younger girlfriend Teresa (Janelle MonÃ¡e) before returning Chiron to his mother Paula (Naomie Harris).Chiron continues to spend time with Juan, who teaches him how to swim and advises him to make his own path in life. One night, Juan encounters Paula smoking crack with one of his customers. Juan berates her for her addiction and she rebukes him for selling crack to her in the first place. She implies that she knows why Chiron gets beaten up by his peers, alluding to \"the way he walks,\" before going home and taking out her frustrations on Chiron. The next day, Chiron admits to Juan and Teresa that he hates his mother and asks what \"faggot\" means. Juan describes it as \"a word used to make gay people feel bad.\" He tells Chiron it is okay to be gay and that he should not allow others to mock him. After asking Juan whether he sold drugs to Paula, Chiron leaves as Juan hangs his head in shame. Now a teenager, Chiron (Ashton Sanders) juggles avoiding school bully Terrel (Patrick Decile) and spending time with Teresa, who has lived alone since Juan's death. Paula supports her crack addiction with prostitution and coerces Chiron into giving her the money Teresa loans him. One night, Chiron has a dream in which his friend Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) has sex with a woman in Teresa's backyard. On another night, Kevin visits Chiron at the beach near his house. While smoking a blunt, the two discuss their ambitions and the nickname Kevin gave Chiron when they were children. They proceed to kiss and Kevin masturbates Chiron. The next morning, Terrel manipulates Kevin into participating in a hazing ritual. Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until he is unable to stand before watching as Terrel and several of his friends stomp on him. When a social worker urges him to reveal his attackers' identities, Chiron refuses, stating that reporting them will not solve anything. The following day, an enraged Chiron storms into class and violently assaults Terrel with a chair. The police arrive and arrest Chiron for assault. As the police escort Chiron out of school, he glares at Kevin. Now going by the nickname \"Black\", an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) deals drugs in Atlanta and receives frequent calls from Paula, who asks him to visit her at the drug treatment center where she now lives. One day, he receives a call from Kevin (AndrÃ© Holland), who invites him to visit him should he decide to come to Miami. The next day, he wakes up and realizes he has had a wet dream. While visiting Paula, Chiron admits that he feels remorse for his lack of empathy towards her. She proceeds to apologize for not loving him when he needed it and tells him she loves him even if he does not love her back. Chiron then travels to Miami and reunites with Kevin, who now works at a diner. When his attempts to probe Chiron about his life result in silence, Kevin tells him that he's had a child with an ex-girlfriend and, although the relationship ended, he is fulfilled by his role as a father. Chiron proceeds to ask Kevin why he called him, to which Kevin plays a song on the jukebox that made him think of Chiron. After dinner, the two drive to Kevin's apartment. Kevin tells Chiron that he is happy despite the fact that his life didn't turn out as he had hoped, resulting in Chiron breaking down and admitting that he has not been intimate with anybody since their encounter on the beach. Kevin comforts him and they embrace. In a flashback, Little stands on a beach in the moonlight."

Her name is Momiji Ooka and she is the Kyoto High School champion of the Karuta game. As fate would have it, Kazuha is going to face Momiji in the Hyakunin Isshu, so she begins to train with the help of Heiji's mother, Shizuka, who is a skilled Karuta player. At the same time, in a Japanese house in Arashiyama, Kyoto's outskirts, the reigning Satsuki Cup champion is murdered. Pictures of the crime scene reveal Momji's presence. Additionally, several Karuta cards were spread around the victim. Conan and Heiji, along with the Osaka and Kyoto police departments, begin their investigation on the Satsuki Cup and the related murder case. As the inquiry goes on, they come across a secret connected with the Hyakunin Isshu."

Though the tragic incident earned him a dishonorable discharge, what ultimately cost him his career, his marriage and any semblance of honor was his unsupported and incredulous claims of what caused it - an attack on his vessel by a mammoth, 70-foot sea creature, believed to be extinct for more than a million years. But when a submersible lies sunk and disabled at the bottom of the ocean - carrying his ex-wife among the team onboard - he is the one who gets the call. Whether a shot at redemption or a suicide mission, Jonas must confront his fears and risk his own life and the lives of everyone trapped below on a single question: Could the Carcharodon Megalodon - the largest marine predator that ever existed - still be alive ... and on the hunt?"
